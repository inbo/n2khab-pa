## Welcome

This repo is meant to keep track of source code for data processing (and optionally, reporting with R markdown)
for 'action 26' of the Flemish Natura 2000 Programme 2016-2020.

The content is typically in Dutch.

### Beware of LFS (large file storage)

This repo also keeps track of the versions of at least one binary report file (large html-file with binary content).
To this aim, [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is being used, in order not to put weight on the git repository itself, regarding diff calculations and such.
Only if you plan to update this html-file, it is necessary that you have git-lfs locally [installed](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation).
Otherwise, the LFS functionality will get corrupted, as found in [this](https://github.com/florisvdh/lfs-testrepo) small test.
